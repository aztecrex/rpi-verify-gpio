# Check if Pi GPIO works at all

Just got my first Pi a couple of weeks ago. Fun as a tiny computer but should
be even more fun when it interacts with the real world. This should get us
some _blinkin' lights_ .

## Test Circuit

LED in series with 220 ohm resistor (https://aztecrex.github.io/rpi-verify-gpio/) .

## Run It

0. `python verify-gpio.py`
0. press the button
0. expect LED to flash
